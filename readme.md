# Scala Workshop


### Project Template Setup

Initial template was set up by installing conscript `cs` and giter8 `g8` commands.

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foundweekends/conscript/master/setup.sh | sh
source ~/.bashrc
 
cs foundweekends/giter8

sbt new unfiltered/unfiltered-netty.g8 --name rental-api
```
